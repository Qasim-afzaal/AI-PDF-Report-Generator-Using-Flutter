# RoofEstimate AI: Intelligent Construction Report Generator  

*Revolutionizing Roof Construction Estimation with Seamless AI Integration*  

---

## Overview  

**RoofEstimate AI** is an advanced Flutter application powered by a domain-specific artificial intelligence model, designed to automate the generation of precise roof construction estimation reports. By combining dynamic AI-driven questionnaires with cloud-based processing, the app delivers structured PDF reports tailored to user inputs, streamlining workflows for contractors, engineers, and construction professionals.  

Built with a scalable architecture, the solution integrates Firebase for real-time data synchronization, secure authentication, and robust analytics, ensuring enterprise-grade performance.

## Key Innovations  

### üß† Context-Aware AI Questionnaire Engine  
- **Domain-Trained Model**: Leverages a proprietary AI trained on roofing material databases, regional cost datasets, and construction blueprints.  
- **Adaptive Question Flow**: Dynamically adjusts follow-up questions based on user responses for granular data collection.  

### ‚ö° Real-Time Report Generation  
- **Structured PDF Templating**: Utilizes LaTeX-inspired engines (e.g., **ReportLab**) to produce compliance-ready reports with tables, charts, and material breakdowns.  
- **Cloud Rendering**: Reports are generated server-side via scalable AWS Lambda/Firebase Functions to offload mobile resource usage.  

### üîí Enterprise-Grade Security  
- **End-to-End Encryption**: User inputs and PDFs are encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).  
- **OAuth 2.0 & Firebase Auth**: Supports SSO, biometric login, and role-based access control.  

### üìä Analytics-Driven Insights  
- **Cost Trend Visualizations**: Embedded D3.js charts in PDFs highlight regional material price fluctuations.  
- **Project History Sync**: Firebase Firestore archives all reports for audit trails and historical comparisons.

## Architectural Blueprint  

### System Components  
1. **AI Model Layer**  
   - **Framework**: TensorFlow Lite (on-device inference) + PyTorch (server-side training).  
   - **Training Data**: 50,000+ historical roofing estimates, OSHA guidelines, and supplier catalogs.  
   - **Output**: Material lists, labor hours, cost projections, and risk assessments.  

2. **Backend Services**  
   - **REST API**: Node.js + Express.js with Swagger documentation.  
   - **PDF Workers**: Python Celery tasks for parallel report generation.  
   - **Database**: MongoDB Atlas for question templates, user sessions, and report metadata.  

3. **Flutter Frontend**  
   - **State Management**: Riverpod for reactive UI updates.  
   - **PDF Viewer**: Syncfusion Flutter PDF for in-app annotations.  
   - **Offline Mode**: Hive DB caches responses when connectivity drops.
